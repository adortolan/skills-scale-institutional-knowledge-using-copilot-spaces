# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

This README centralizes links to all process documentation for OctoAcme’s project management and provides a concise overview of our key workflows, roles, communication practices, and quality assurance expectations. Use this as a single source of truth to onboard teammates, find process artifacts, and reference required checklists.

OctoAcme structures projects around a clear lifecycle: Initiation, Planning, Execution, Release, and Retrospective. Initiation captures the problem, objectives, success metrics, stakeholders, and a high-level timeline in a Project One-pager. Approved initiatives move into planning where teams create prioritized backlogs, size work, define a Definition of Done, and map releases and milestones. Risks and dependencies are tracked in a Risk Register and reviewed in kickoff and weekly planning syncs so mitigation plans are identified early.

Execution follows lightweight, repeatable workflows focused on small, testable increments and fast feedback loops. Teams track work on a project board (Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done). Pull requests should be small, reference an issue with acceptance criteria, and be gated by CI (tests, linters, security scans) plus reviewer approvals. Regular rituals—daily standups, weekly delivery syncs, and demos—keep progress visible and enable fast escalation when blockers appear.

Roles and responsibilities are explicit to reduce ambiguity: Project Managers coordinate delivery, schedule work, manage risks and stakeholder communication; Product Managers own outcomes, priorities, and success metrics; Developers implement and test; QA validates acceptance and quality; and Stakeholders provide inputs and approvals. Quality assurance spans unit and integration tests, CI security scans, manual QA where needed, pre-release smoke tests and checklists, plus post-deploy verifications and incident playbooks. Retrospectives and tracked action items drive continuous improvement.
